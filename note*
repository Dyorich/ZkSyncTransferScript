This script demonstrates how to use ZkSync's JavaScript library to send ETH (Ethereum) from your ZkSync wallet to a recipient address. You'll need to replace "your-private-key" with your actual private key.

Please note that this is a basic example, and you may need to adjust the code based on your specific requirements, such as network selection, token selection, or additional transaction parameters.

Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed, including ethers and zksync libraries. You can install them by running npm install ethers zksync.

Remember to exercise caution when working with cryptocurrencies and ensure you have a good understanding of the risks involved.
